                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>With the advent of the internet and technologies in our country, there have been numerous advancements in terms of arranging appointments for doctors in hospitals, but there are no efficient home visit services for Physiotherapy available as of yet. As physiotherapy treatment is most efficient on physical interaction, home visit services will be more beneficial. Despite the fact that many people require physiotherapy, our country still lacks efficient physiotherapy facilities.</p>
                <p>“Home Physio” is Nepal’s most efficient Delivery Network for Physiotherapy services. Here, we are committed to increase access to quality physio care through highly-skilled practitioners. Our multi-therapy approach helps keep a strong focus on patient needs and deliver the highest level of patient centric care with better outcomes.. We want to help people who can't get to the hospital because of their injuries or medical disabilities, as well as elderly people, infants, and pregnant women. We aim to assist people of all ages seeking relief from pain related to back, knee, neck, etc. and also get support in the related problems that occur due to certain kind of diseases like Paralysis, Parkinson’s, Stroke. This service will not only be beneficial for the patients but also will economically benefit the physiotherapist as they can work as they can work according to their own set schedule without interference from others. In this way, we will be able to utilize the manpower existing in the country in the best possible way so that their knowledge and experience is well mobilized.</p>
                <p>We work with you through your healing from start to finish providing a robust program involving combination of multiple therapies. Also, after treatment is over, we provide support / guidance to prevent injury from repeating / pain from returning. The happiness on our patient’s faces is what keeps us going.</p>
